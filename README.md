# RUNashville
>RUNashville is a place for Nashville's running community to coordinate races and share information about their personal training. The site serves four categories of users: public viewers, community members, community admins, and super admins. After a user logs in, they can view and potentially modify daily community runs and upcoming races, and check in on other community members via posts on a social feed.
